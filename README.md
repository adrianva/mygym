# mygym
Project with simple API to create, retrieve, edit and delete workouts.
You need to have installed Pyhton 2.7 in order to run it.
STILL IN PROGRESS.

## Requirements

On the backend side, first you need to install the dependencies:
- Open a terminal.
- Go to the project directory: `cd /path/to/project/`
- Type the following command: `pip install requirements,txt`


## Edit some config files

On the backend side, you'll need to edit the file `api/conf/my.cnf` and provide your credentials in order to connect to the MySQL database.

On the frontend side, you have to edit the file `frontend/js/main.js`and change the variable CONFIG with the IP of your server.
